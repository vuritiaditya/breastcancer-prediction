performance comparison between different machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression ,Decision tree and SVM, on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets is done. We have to predict the Stage of Breast Cancer - M (Malignant) and B (Benign). The main objective is to assess the correctness in classifying data with respect to accuracy and efficiency of each algorithm.
